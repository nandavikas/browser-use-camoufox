"""Browser connection — the bring-up + lifetime layer.

Phase 5a of the firefox-compat porting effort. Where :mod:`adapter`
abstracts *page-level operations* (goto, click, evaluate), this module
abstracts the *session-level resources* a :class:`BrowserSession` owns:

  - The long-lived control channel to the browser process (a CDP
    WebSocket for Chromium, a Playwright BiDi connection for Firefox).
  - Lifecycle (``start`` / ``stop`` of that channel).
  - Target discovery — listing tabs/pages, attaching to a specific one.

A :class:`BrowserConnection` is intentionally *narrower* than a full
Playwright Browser handle: it surfaces just enough for
:class:`BrowserSession` to bring itself up without leaking
protocol-specific types into the rest of browser-use.

Two implementations ship here:

  - :class:`CdpBrowserConnection` wraps the existing ``cdp_use.CDPClient``.
    Mirrors what :meth:`BrowserSession.connect` already does today —
    nothing functionally new on the Chromium path.

  - :class:`BidiBrowserConnection` wraps a Playwright ``Browser``
    obtained by connecting to a Firefox / Camoufox WebSocket endpoint
    (or by launching one in-process via the engine). Provides the same
    surface so :class:`BrowserSession` can bring up cleanly on Firefox
    targets.

What this commit does NOT do:

  - Refactor every watchdog to consume the connection (Phase 5b/c/d).
  - Make ``Agent.run`` work end-to-end on Firefox — most watchdogs
    still talk raw ``session.cdp_client.send.*`` and would fail on a
    BidiBrowserConnection. The path opens; the trail still needs
    cutting. See ``docs/ADAPTERS.md`` for the boundary doctrine.
